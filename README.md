# discord-token-gen

An auto discord token generator. Auto verifies phone number but not email. Still working on it.

# Why no SRC?

This is an open-source code project before but unfortunately, I remove the source code
due to I've seen there have already at least 5 people tried to change my name to his own and resell it
I can found people like that on some forums every few months it is really annoying I'm really tired of seeing that

and no this is not malicious, you can easily track the background connect requests
it only connects to discord.com except when you open the tool it will check the last update version
